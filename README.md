<p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, there are many different kinds of switches in the market. According to the quantity of devices you have and the people who use the network, you need to choose corresponding switch. Broadly speaking, if you want to expand your network without big expense, the basic Ethernet switch is a better choice for small and medium environments to boost performance and efficiency of network, such as 16-port and 24-port Gigabit switch. For small-sized families, an 8-port Gigabit switch would be adequate. This article will put emphasis on 8-port Gigabit switch and selection considerations.</p>

<h2>Overview of 8-port Gigabit Switch</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today we would take FS.COM S1130-8T2F managed PoE+ switch as an example to have a rough idea of 8 port Gigabit switch. S1130-8T2F comes with 8x 10/100/1000Base-T RJ45 Ethernet ports, 1x console port and 2x Gigabit SFP slots. It can supply power to network equipment such as weather-proof IP cameras, VoIP phones and wireless access points (WAP). This managed PoE+ switch is highly flexible with high resistance to electromagnetic interference. It also features high performance in stability and environmental adaptability. The detailed specification of S1130-8T2F 8 port switch is shown in the below:</p>

<h2>Selection Considerations of 8-port Gigabit Switch</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Careful planning before purchasing a switch will help you save money. In the meantime, it can help you ensure the equipment has the functionality that you organization needs, or the switches can expand their capabilities as your requirements change and grow. Here are some considerations that you can refer to help guide your 8 port Gigabit switch purchase.</p>

<div>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Power over Ethernet (PoE) or Non-PoE</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PoE is the capability of the switch to deliver power to a device over the existing Ethernet cable which can simplify the cabling process and cut network cost, such as VoIP phones and some wireless access points. An 8-port PoE switch is one of the most popular PoE switches for IP camera system.</p>

<div>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Unmanaged or Managed</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unmanaged switch can only provide basic connectivity between devices without user configuration. While managed switch can be customized to enhance the functionality of a certain network and allow users to adjust speed, monitors traffic and report network activity. In the long run, a managed 8-port Gigabit switch may be a better choice.</p>

<div>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Stackable or Standalone</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As network improves, you will need more switches to provide network connectivity to meet the need of growing number of devices in the network. When using standalone switches, each switch is managed and configured as an individual entity. ByÂ comparison, stackable switches offer a way to simplify and increase the availability of the network.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 8-port <a href="https://www.fs.com/c/1g-switches-3255" target="new">Gigabit switch</a> is a structured wiring solution designed to satisfy the needs of bandwidth-intensive networking applications. With a plug and play installation, it is in a position to transmit gigabit-speed Ethernet through the network. From this article you may have a basic knowledge about 8 port Gigabit switch. If you are interested in it, FS.COM would be one of your choice.</p>
